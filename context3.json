//14:56 first & second commit? (IS THIS COMMIT TIME OR PUSH TIME?)
//14:57 third & fourth commit
//14:58 opened PR
//14:59 fifth commit
//15:00 sixth commit
//15:00 closed PR
//15:01 seventh commit
//15:02 re-opened PR
//15:02 merge
// GIVEN 5 & 6 were pushed together, this is likely COMMIT rather than PUSH time. Great!
